# Lubin Laboratory - MELT Team Software Github Workshop
Demo Repository to Teach Git and GitHub

## What is Git and Github?
* Git: Software to track changes to code 
* Github: A place to store code

## Why Use Git and Github?
* Quicker and easier to collaborate on code and projects
* Create "checkpoints" and maintain a version history in case something goes very very wrong (anecdote)

## Terminology
* Repository - where the code is stored online
* Branch - Your own workspace, essentially
* Master/main - Master copy of working code
* Committing - the "checkpoint"
* Pushing - updating the code on the repository

## Basic Workflow
This PDF has pretty much everything you'd need: https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf
1. Add - "stating" what you will save
2. Commit - "saving" what you changed
3. Push - "updating" GitHub
4. If applicable: merging and creating pull requests
5. Sometimes: fixing merge conflicts
